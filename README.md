Getting Started
---------------

Once you have the necessary Ruby and Rails dependencies (see above), you will need to install the required Gems.

To do this, simply run
```
bundle install --without production
```

Once these have been installed, you will need to create and seed your development database.
```
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

This will create your database in `db/development.sqlite3` and create the Admin user.
